Abstract: Understanding climate change adaptation constraints for different actors – governments, communities, individuals, and households – is essential, as adaptation turns into a matter of survival. Though rich qualitative research reveals constraints for diverse cases, methods to consolidate knowledge and elicit patterns in adaptation constraints for various actors are scarce. Therefore, this work analyzes associations between different adaptations and actors’ constraints to climate-induced floods and sea-level rise. Our novel approach derives textual data from peer-reviewed articles (published before February 2024) by using natural language processing, thematic coding books, and network analysis. Results show that social capital, economic factors, and government support are constraints shared among all actors.
